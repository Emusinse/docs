## Risc-V Processor
I want to investigate RISC-V processors and uploading code to them. DFU by default has a small RISC_V bootloader running to upload bitstream. Can Actually use this to run code.  Maybe I can upgrade to a more fully fledged project.  Can we implment a wisbone connection?

## Verilator Sim
Want to flesh out a verilator based workflow for developing my own ip blocks.
